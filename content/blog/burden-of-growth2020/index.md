*"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."*


**What do you think about people following in someone else's footsteps?**

In order to fulfill our dreams, we must continue to pass it onto the next generation. We cannot accomplish everything that we want in one lifetime. The best we can do is have our future generations do it for us and watch from above. They continue the cycle by passing their dreams to their future generations. Sadly, this innocent dream gets lost in pressure to which “tiger parents” lead to unnecessary pressure throughout the younger generations. There are pleasant people with good intentions, but bad influences. They may be nice to you, but their actions could lead you to a path that differs from one that is otherwise desirable. Imposter syndrome is the one that comes most often to mind but it can be other things such as procrastination, failure, peer pressure,  or an idolization that leads to an obsessing desire to copy their every action. Continue their legacy, but do not become so infatuated that you lose your self worth in the process.


**Who do I admire?**

Most people say they idolize someone. I take inspiration from people, but I do not idolize anyone. By idolizing and admiring someone solely, you lose out on the bigger picture and become obsessed with worshipping their every deed. If I were forced to idolize someone, it’d be me in the future for remaining strong and conquering all the roadblocks ahead of him. If everyone was perfect and based their images on the successes of other people, we’d all be one and the same human being.
