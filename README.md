# mprado.ml
my personal website/blog based on [the gatsby starter blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) to replace my stupid google sites version when I get around to it??? or maybe i just give up and pay for wordpress or squarespace instead...hell i might even redo this to use another gatsby starter or switch to another framework completely and then work on valkyriepcs or 3wth next? so much to do, so little time
